#  Open Web UI Assistant Library (Jan 2025)

25-Jan-25

## Purpose Statement

The purpose of this repository is to share configurations for custom models that can be imported into the (excellent!) Open Web UI front end for interacting with large language models via their APIs.

As an upstream source for the configurations, this repository has my public assistants repository as a sub module. 

As AI tools have evolved at such an incredible pace, we've seen some emerging standards for how to configure what have typically been provided as assistants on dedicated platforms (say, OpenAI Assistants API).

The emerging norm is that there isn't a hard need to ringfence these type of LLM tools from other ones. Rather by adding a system prompt and a RAG pipeline to a standard "off the shelf" LLM (accessed via its API), the same intended behavior can be achieved.
