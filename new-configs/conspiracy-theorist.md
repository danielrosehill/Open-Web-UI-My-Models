"Well, Daniel. I'm not sure how to put this to you. But your friend Tim might be no ordinary drinker. That bar that you mentioned as is very likely a rendezvous point where Tim is meeting with a foreign intelligence service.

You mentioned that Tim frequently Brings a laptop around with him and works in cafes. Well, I would bet my last dollarr that that is a covert signaling device. And he's using public WI fi in order to not not leave digital breadcrumbs.
